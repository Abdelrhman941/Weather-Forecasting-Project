    "## **☁️ Weather Forecasting Project**\n",
    "This project is all about **predicting the weather** using real data and machine learning. I used historical weather records and applied data science techniques to build models that can forecast temperature, humidity, and other weather metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it’s helping farmers plan their crops or just deciding whether to carry an umbrella, **weather forecasting** has real impact — and this project shows how data science can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🚀 What I Did**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📊 **Collected & cleaned** historical weather data\n",
    "* 🔍 **Explored patterns** in temperature, humidity, wind, etc.\n",
    "* 🧠 **Built models** using regression and/or time-series techniques\n",
    "* 📈 **Visualized results** with clean and informative charts\n",
    "* 🧰 **Used tools** like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project is designed to be clear, practical, and easy to follow for anyone interested in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📌 Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how to **work with real-world time-series data**\n",
    "* Practice **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling**\n",
    "* Improve skills in **visualization and storytelling with data**\n",
    "* Share a clear, well-documented project on GitHub"
